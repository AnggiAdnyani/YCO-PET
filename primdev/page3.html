                        new four-legged friend into our homes, as the Kennel 
                        Club saw dog ownership rise by nearly eight per cent over the pandemic.

                    <p> Is your dog obsessed with the beach?
                        If hanging out under an umbrella and splashing 
                        in the ocean is you and your pup’s idea of a good time, 
                        there’s no doubt you’ll be heading over to the beach 
                        all summer long.In order to focus on the fun and less on worrying,
                        we reached out to Dr. Keith Mihansky, a medical director at Veterinary 
                        Emergency Group in New Jersey, and Kimberly Marie Freeman.

                    <h2> Japanese man spends S$21,600 on super realistic dog costume so he can be a dog</h2>
                    <p> In an interview with Mynavi, Toko said he loves four-legged animals and has dreams of becoming an animal one day.
                        And when he finally received his collie dog costume, he tweeted: "I ordered a costume! 
                        Thanks to you, I was able to fulfil my dream of becoming an animal!"
                        Toko commissioned the costume from the Japanese company Zeppet, which is a 
                        studio that makes models for movies, commercials and corporations.
                        hey also take in requests from individuals like Toko, 
                        but these types of orders are only 10 per cent of the work they do overall.
